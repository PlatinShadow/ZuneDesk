## What is ZuneDesk?
ZuneDesk is a desktop overlay for playing music. It's inspired by the Zune UI. 

## Download
Check the [Releases](https://github.com/PlatinShadow/ZuneDesk/releases) for the newest download.

## Features
This is still in very early development, so there aren't many features.
But the overlay is already somewhat integrated with Windows APIs for getting information about the currently playing media. 

## Helping
If you find any bugs or would like to request a feature please open a new [issue](https://github.com/PlatinShadow/ZuneDesk/issues).

## Plans
- [x] System Media Transport Controls integration
- [ ] Audio Visualizer
- [ ] Audio File Playback?
- [ ] Spotify integration
- [ ] Zune Syncing?
