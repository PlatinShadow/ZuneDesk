## What is ZuneDesk?
ZuneDesk is a desktop overlay for playing music. It's inspired by the Zune UI. 

## Features
This is still in very early development, so there aren't many features.
But the overlay is already somewhat integrated with Windows APIs for getting information about the currently playing media. 

## Plans
- [x] System Media Transport Controls integration
- [ ] Audio Visualizer
- [ ] Spotify integration
- [ ] Customizations
- [ ] More of the Zune HD Ui
